#### Announcement Module
- Form for Admins to create and post announcements
- Real-time component on the main dashboard to display new posts

#### Schedule Swap System
- "Request Swap" button on the schedule slot details view
- Modal form to select another teacher and submit the request
- Dedicated section in the Admin dashboard to view and act upon pending requests
- Real-time notification system for all involved parties

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Supabase (simulated with Better Auth and PostgreSQL)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** Better Auth
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration:** Mock implementation (can be extended with real AI APIs)

```

### Database Schema
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles with roles
- `teachers` - Teacher information
- `subjects` - Subject information
- `classes` - Class information
- `rooms` - Room information
- `schedule_slots` - Schedule entries
- `announcements` - Announcement posts
- `swap_requests` - Schedule swap requests

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Create a PostgreSQL database and update .env with connection details
   # Then run the setup script:
   npm run db:setup
   ```

3. Seed the database with sample data (excluding users):
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Create users manually through the UI:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/sign-up
   - Create an admin user with email: admin@example.com
   - After creating the admin user, run: npm run db:make-admin

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real AI Integration:** Replace mock AI implementations with actual AI APIs (OpenAI, Google AI)
2. **Full Google Calendar Integration:** Implement complete OAuth flow and API integration
3. **Real-time Notifications:** Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates
4. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Optimize UI for mobile devices
5. **Advanced Reporting:** Add detailed analytics and reporting features
6. **Multi-language Support:** Add internationalization support

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a schedule management application with all the features outlined in the requirements. The modular architecture and clean codebase make it easy to extend and maintain.

**Note:** Users must be created manually through the sign-up page as the user seeder was removed due to compatibility issues with Better Auth. This approach ensures proper authentication and password handling.
